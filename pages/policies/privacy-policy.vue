          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          How do you use my personal data?
          <p>
            If we do collect any personal data (i.e. if you contact us), it will
            be processed and stored securely, for no longer than is necessary in
            light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. We will
            comply with our obligations and safeguard your rights under the Data
            Protection Legislation at all times. For more details on security
            see Part 7, below.
          </p>
          <p>
            As stated above, we do not generally collect any personal data, but
            if you contact us and we obtain your personal details from your
            email, we may use them to respond to your email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any and all emails containing your personal data will be deleted no
            later than 60 Months after project completion and no other personal
            data will be retained.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties
            for any purposes (other than storage on an email server).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          How and where do you store my data?
          <p>
            We will only store your personal data in the UK. This means that it
            will be fully protected under the Data Protection Legislation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may store some or all of your personal data in countries that are
            not part of the [uropean Economic Area (the “EEA” consists of all EU
            member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). These are
            known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws
            that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means
            that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your
            personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be
            within the UK and under the Data Protection Legislation:
          </p>
          <p>
            We store your data with external third parties, as detailed below in
            Part 8, that are based outside of the EEA. The following
            safeguard(s) is/are applied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We will only transfer your personal data to third countries whose
              levels of data protection are deemed ‘adequate’ by the European
              Commission. More information is available from the European
              Commission.
            </li>
            <li>
              We use specific contracts with external third parties that are
              approved by the European Commission for the transfer of personal
              data to third countries. Contracts like this require the same
              levels of personal data protection that would apply under the Data
              Protection Legislation. More information is available from the
              European Commission.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we transfer your data to a third party based in the US, the
              data may be protected if they are part of the EU-US Privacy
              Shield. This requires that third party to provide data protection
              to standards similar to those in Europe. More information is
              available from the European Commission.<br>
              Please contact us using the details below in Part 10 for further
              information about the particular data protection mechanism[s] used
              by us when transferring your personal data to a third country.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal data security is essential to us, and to protect personal
              data, we take the following measures:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Limiting access to your personal data to those employees,
                  agents, contractors, and other third parties with a legitimate
                  need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of
                  confidentiality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or
                  unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
                  disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including
                  notifying you and/or the Information Commissioner’s Office
                  where we are legally required to do so.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you share my personal data?
          <p>
            We will not share any of your personal data with any third parties
            for any purposes, subject to the following exception(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, your
            personal data may be transferred to a third party. Any new owner of
            our business may continue to use your personal data in the same way
            that we have used it, as specified in this privacy policy (i.e. to
            communicate with you).
          </p>
          <p>
            In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share
            certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved
            in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court
            order, or the instructions of a government authority.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            If any of your personal data is transferred to a third party, as
            described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal
            data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your
            rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the
            law, as described above in Part 7.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will take
            suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated
            just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under
            the Data Protection Legislation, as explained above in Part 7.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or assets, your
            personal data may be transferred to a third party. Any new owner of
            our business may continue to use your personal data in the same
            way(s) that we have used it, as specified in this Privacy Policy
            (i.e. to communicate with you).
          </p>
          <p>
            In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share
            certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved
            in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court
            order, or the instructions of a government authority.

        <li>
          How can I access my personal data?
          <p>
            If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can
            ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where
            any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access
            request”.
          </p>
          <p>
            All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to
            the email or postal addresses shown in Part 10. To make this as easy
            as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for
            you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest
            way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to your request
            as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If
            your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if
            you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our
            administrative costs in responding.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will respond to your subject access request within 14 days and,
            in any case, not more than one month of receiving it. Normally, we
            aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your
            personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly
            if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a
            maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You
            will be kept fully informed of our progress.
          </p>

          How do I contact you?
