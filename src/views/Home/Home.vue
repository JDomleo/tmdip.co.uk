        Making sure site surveys are conducted correctly means the <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> drawings will produce perfect manufacture drawings in either 2D or 3D detail. All of these items are then laid onto the survey to make every piece of the jigsaw fit together.
      </p>

        Project costs are a priority in the interest of {{ companyName }} and our clients, which means efficient methods need to be incorporated into projects. Detailed programmes with realistic timescales are important in every project and we aim to start and complete on the required dates with the minimum of fuss for the client. Our project managers will organise everything to make sure the project runs smoothly on time, in a safe and efficient manner. We will also organise and co-ordinate all sub-trades.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to any project running safely is the ability to have a safe running site. Our health &amp; safety advisers continually make sure that {{ companyNameWithLtd }} are fully up to date with the current health &amp; safety regulations and check that the site is fully compliant with all requirements. Our site managers are trained to continually check sites to make sure it’s a clean and safe working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The addition of our building division gives us the ability to expand our working portfolio. We are currently undertaking various other projects which include a 200 square meter new build house and a 8 bedroom HMO. Having a building division will also give us the ability to take on the build section of the project, which brings more of the project under one roof, making it more cost effective and helping the project stay on schedule.
