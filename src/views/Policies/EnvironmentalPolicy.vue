          Sustainable Strategy:   To achieve this, as a company we will strive to integrate sustainability into all aspects of what we do.  This will be considered from the advice we give to clients - to our considerations for resourcing of materials for installations - from being a great place to work - to minimising our own environmental impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emergency Planning:
          <p>
            In the event of an environmental accident at site it is imperative that a plan of action is available to prevent and mitigate against any environmental impact. The aspects that have been identified as possibly leading to environmental situation include unplanned asbestos release; existing site contamination; spillages including fuel or substances used on site. The size and scale of environmental incidents will or may vary from site to site. It may be possible that any smaller spillage and leaks can be cleared in a controlled manner by site operatives. Considerations must be taken for the use of external contractors/emergency teams where any incident has exceeded the clear up limits of an individual.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Action:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Once the manager/supervisor/responsible person as been notified of any potential or actual environmental incident the following action must be taken.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evacuate the area where the incident as occurred.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take reasonable steps /actions to prevent where possible the spread of further contamination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secure the area and prevent access to the best of their ability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protect where possible escape of contaminants into any nearby water courses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notify anyone nearby who may also be affected.
            </li>
          </ul>
